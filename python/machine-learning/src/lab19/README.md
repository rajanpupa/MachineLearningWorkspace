# Classification using sklearn python

Supervised learning example using python library

* pre_terrain_data.py randomly generate data for gradient, bumpiness of road vs speed

* ClassifyNB.py creates a Gaussian Niave Bayes classifier

* Pass the data and corresponding labels array to the classifier and fit into it(learn)

* Now pass any unseen data to the classifier and ask for classification

* Final run `python StudentMain.py`

* Should create a picture called `test.png` which has the classification result
